# Title: OOP Test

Several OOP challenges.

- Repository: `OOPTest`
- Link github: https://github.com/elduderinow/OOPtest
- Language: PHP

## PURPOSE
An introduction to OOP.

## PROGRESS
I've used OOP before in the Pokedex and the Shop assignment. But some things were new like the parents::, extented classes and overal capabilities what an class/object can do.
Very fun to work with and I already see the great possibilities.


## THE PROJECT ITSELF & MY OPINION
Great explanation of OOP, learned a few things extra which is nice!
The challenges were not so challenging, but great to work with OOP.
